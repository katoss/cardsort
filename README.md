Cardsort helps UX researchers quickly analyse data from open card sorting exercises using hierarchical cluster analysis. This task helps to understand how people organize information, and is frequently used to develop information architectures for websites. Click [here](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-definition/) to learn more about the card sorting method.

__More precisely, cardsort helps you to:__
* Create distance matrices using hierarchical cluster analysis
* Create dendrograms from based on these matrices
* Extract user-generated category-labels
* Using data exports from [kardsort.com](https://kardsort.com/)

## Documentation
[cardsort.readthedocs.io](https://cardsort.readthedocs.io)

## Quick start
### Installation

```bash
$ pip install cardsort
```

### Usage

`cardsort` can be used to create dendrograms and extract user-generated category-labels:

```python
from cardsort import analysis
import pandas as pd

path = "example-data.csv" # data with columns: card_id, card_label, category_id, category_label, user_id
df = pd.read_csv(path) 
```

The data used in this example can be found under [/docs/example-data.csv](https://github.com/katoss/cardsort/blob/main/docs/example-data.csv).

__Create a dendrogram that summarizes user-generated clusters__
```python
analysis.create_dendrogram(df)
```

__Output__

![Dendrogram plot generated from example data](https://github.com/katoss/cardsort/blob/main/docs/dendrogram.png?raw=true)

__Learn which category labels users gave to clusters__
```python
cards = ['Banana', 'Apple']
analysis.get_cluster_labels(df, cards)
```
__Output__
```python
['Healthy snacks', 'Snacks', 'Fruits', 'Food']
```

### Accepted data
* This package works with data exports from [kardsort.com](https://kardsort.com/) (Export format 'Casolysis Data (.csv) - Recommended')
* This data equals the following structure: ```card_id, card_label, category_id, category_label, user_id```

### Advanced usage
See [documentation](https://cardsort.readthedocs.io)
